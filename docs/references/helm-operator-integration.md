# Integration with the Helm Operator

You can release charts to your cluster via "GitOps", by combining Flux
and the [Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator).

The essential mechanism is this: the declaration of a Helm release is
represented by a custom resource, specifying the chart and its
values. If you put such a resource in your git repo as a file, Flux
will apply it to the cluster, and once it's in the cluster, the Helm
Operator will make sure the release exists by installing or upgrading
it.

## Upgrading images in a `HelmRelease` using Flux

If the chart you're using in a `HelmRelease` lets you specify the
particular images to run, you will usually be able to update them with
Flux, the same way you can with Deployments and so on.

!!!note
    For automation to work, the repository _and_ tag should be
    defined (either as a whole string, or under separate keys), as Flux
    determines image updates based on what it reads in the `.spec.values`
    of the `HelmRelease`.

### Automated image detection

Flux interprets certain commonly used structures in the `values`
section of a `HelmRelease` as referring to images, at least an
`image` key needs to be specified.  The following are understood
(showing just the `values` section):

```yaml
values:
  image: repo/image:version
```

```yaml
values:
  image: repo/image
  tag: version
```

```yaml
values:
  registry: docker.io
  image: repo/image
  tag: version
```

```yaml
values:
  image:
    repository: repo/image
    tag: version
```

```yaml
values:
  image:
    registry: docker.io
    repository: repo/image
    tag: version
```

These can appear at the top level (immediately under `values:`), or in
a subsection (under a key, itself under `values:`). Other values
may be mixed in arbitrarily. Here's an example of a values section
that specifies two images:

```yaml
values:
  persistent: true

  # image that will be labeled "chart-image"
  image: repo/image1:version

  subsystem:
    # image that will be labeled "subsystem"
    image:
      repository: repo/image2
      tag: version
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    port: 4040
```

### Annotations

If Flux does not automatically detect your image, it is possible to
map the image paths by alias with YAML dot notation annotations. An
alias overrules a detected image.

The following annotations are available, and `repository.fluxcd.io`
is required for any of these to take effect.

| Annotation                         | Value            | Required? |
|------------------------------------|------------------|   :---:   |
| **`fluxcd.io/automated`**          | `"true"`         |     ✅ <br> * Note: This must be a string `"true"` <br> rather than a boolean `true` or all other `*.fluxcd.io/*` <br> annotations will be silently ignored    |
| **`repository.fluxcd.io/<alias>`** | `sub.repo`       |     ✅    |
| `registry.fluxcd.io/<alias>`       | `sub.reg`        |           |
| `tag.fluxcd.io/<alias>`            | `sub.tag`        |           |
| `filter.fluxcd.io/<alias>`         | `glob:master-*`  |           |


!!!note
    Note: Glob patterns following `glob:` are sensitive to spaces

The following example `HelmRelease` specifies two images:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    # image and tag
    repository.fluxcd.io/app: appImage
    tag.fluxcd.io/app: appTag
    filter.fluxcd.io/app: 'glob:*'
    # nested image with registry and tag
    registry.fluxcd.io/submarine: sub.marinesystem.reg
    repository.fluxcd.io/submarine: sub.marinesystem.img
    tag.fluxcd.io/submarine: sub.marinesystem.tag

spec:
  values:
    # image and tag
    appImage: repo/image1
    appTag: version
    sub:
      marinesystem:
        # nested image with registry and tag
        reg: domain.com
        img: repo/image2
        tag: version
```

#### Filters

You can use the [same annotations](fluxctl.md) in
the `HelmRelease` as you would for a Deployment or other workload,
to control updates and automation. For the purpose of specifying
filters, the container name is either `chart-image` (if at the top
level), the key under which the image is given (e.g., `"subsystem"`
from the example above), or the alias you are using in your
annotations.

Top level image example:

```yaml
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  annotations:
    fluxcd.io/automated: "true"
    filter.fluxcd.io/chart-image: semver:~4.0
spec:
  values:
    image:
      repository: bitnami/mongodb
      tag: 4.0.3
```

Sub-section images example:

```yaml
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  annotations:
    fluxcd.io/automated: "true"
    filter.fluxcd.io/prometheus: semver:~2.3
    filter.fluxcd.io/alertmanager: glob:v0.15.*
    filter.fluxcd.io/nats: regex:^0.6.*
spec:
  values:
    prometheus:
      image: prom/prometheus:v2.3.1
    alertmanager:
      image: prom/alertmanager:v0.15.0
    nats:
      image:
        repository: nats-streaming
        tag: 0.6.0
```
