# Summary

Flux daemon (fluxd, aka flux agent) allows automation of application deployments and version control of cluster configuration.
Version controlling of cluster manifests provides reproducibility and a historical trail of events.

## Flux daemon responsibilities

    A) Continuous Deployment
	    1.
        Flux daemon monitors user git repo Kubernetes manifests for changes, which it
        then deploys to the cluster.

	    2.
	    Flux daemon monitors container registry for running container image updates.
        Detection of an image change (running container image tag vs container
        registry image tag) triggers k8s manifest update, which is committed to the
        user git repository, then deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

    B) Deployment approaches
        1.
        Automate vs Deautomate
            Deployment happens automatically when a new image tag is detected.
            Deautomated deployment will not proceed until manually released (through
            the UI or the CLI tool fluxctl).
            
        2.
        Lock vs Unlock
            Deployment is pinned to a particular image tag. New deployment will not
            proceed upon triggered release.
    
# Flags

fluxd requires setup and offers customization though a multitude of flags.

|flag                    | default                       | purpose |
