# Upgrading to Flux v1

Flux v1 is a major improvement over the previous versions, and is
different enough that you need to do a bit of work to upgrade it.

In previous releases of Flux, much of the work was done by the
service. This meant that to get a useful system, you had to run both
the daemon and the service in your cluster. In version 1, the daemon
does all of the mechanical work by itself.

## Differences between Old Flux and Flux v1

In version 1 the daemon is more self-sufficient and easier to set
up. It is also more capable, and in particular, it now synchronises
your cluster with the manifests you keep in git -- enabling you to use
git (and GitHub) workflows to manage your cluster.

## Upgrade process

In summary, you will need to:

 1. Remove the old Flux resources from your cluster
 2. Delete any deployment keys
 3. Run the new Flux resources
 4. Install a new deploy key

First, it will help in a few places to have an old fluxctl
around. Download it from GitHub:

```sh
curl -o fluxctl_030 https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/download/0.3.0/fluxctl_linux_amd64
# or if using macOS,
# curl -o fluxctl_030 https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/download/0.3.0/fluxctl_darwin_amd64
chmod a+x ./fluxctl_030
```

## If you are running Flux in "standalone" mode

Set the environment variable FLUX_URL to point to the Flux service you
are running, as described in
[the old deployment docs](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/0.3.0/site/using.md#fluxctl-setup). The
particular URL will differ, depending on how you have told Kubernetes
to expose the Flux service.

Before making any changes, get the config so that it can be consulted later:

```
./fluxctl_030 get-config --fingerprint=md5 | tee old-config.yaml
```

### Remove old Flux resources

> *Important! If you have Flux resources committed to git*
>
> The first thing to do here is to remove any manifests for running
> Flux you have stored in git, before deleting them in the cluster
> (below). If you don’t remove these, running the new Flux daemon will
> restore the old configuration.

You can delete the Flux resources by referring to the manifest files
used to create them. If you don’t have the files on hand, you can try
using the example deployment as a stand-in:

```sh
git clone --branch 0.3.0 git@github.com:weaveworks/flux flux-0.3.0
kubectl delete --ignore-not-found -R -f ./flux-0.3.0/deploy
```

That’s something of a sledgehammer! But it should cover most cases.

### Delete deployment keys

It’s good practice to remove any unused deployment keys. If you’re
using GitHub, look at the settings for the repository you were
pointing Flux at, and delete the key Flux was using. To check you are
removing the correct key, you can see the fingerprint of the key used
by Flux in the file `old-config.yaml` that was created earlier.

### Configure and run new Flux resources

> First, it is important to understand that Flux manages more of your
> cluster resources now. It will automatically apply the manifests
> that appear in your config repo, either by creating or by updating
> them.  In other words, it tries to keep the cluster running whatever
> is represented in the repo. (Though it doesn’t delete things, yet).

To run Flux without connecting to Weave Cloud, adapt the manifests
provided in the
[Flux repo](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/tree/master/deploy)
with the git parameters (URL, path, and branch) from
`old-config.yaml`, and then apply them with `kubectl`. Consider adding
these adapted manifests to your own config repo.

The daemon now has an API itself, so you can point fluxctl directly at
it (the example manifests include a Kubernetes service so you can do
just that).

You may find that you need to set FLUX_URL again, to take account of
the new deployment. See the
[setup instructions](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/1.0.1/site/standalone/setup.md#connecting-fluxctl-to-the-daemon)
for guidance.

To see the SSH key created by Flux, download the latest fluxctl from
[the release page](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/tag/1.0.1)
and run:

```sh
fluxctl identity
```

You will need to add this as a deploy key, which is also described in
the setup instructions linked above.

## Troubleshooting

### The `kubectl delete` commands didn’t delete anything

It’s possible that the Flux resources are in an unusual namespace or
given a different name. As a last resort, you can hunt down the
resources by name and delete them. Use kubectl to look for likely
suspects.

```sh
kubectl get serviceaccount,service,deployment --all-namespaces
```

Have a look for deployments and services with “flux” in the name.

### I deleted the Flux resources but when I install Flux v1 they come back

The most likely explanation is that you have manifests for the
resources in your config repo. When Flux v1 starts, it does a sync --
and if there are manifests for the old Flux still in git, it will
create those as resources.

If that’s the case, you will need to remove the manifests from git
before running Flux v1.
