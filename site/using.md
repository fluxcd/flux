title: Using Weave Flux
menu_order: 40
---

All of the features of Flux are accessible from within
[Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works).

However, `fluxctl` provides an equivalent API that can be used from
the command line.

Download the latest version of the fluxctl client
[from github](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases).

The `--help` for `fluxctl` is described below.

# Connecting fluxctl to the daemon

You need to tell `fluxctl` where to find the Flux API and to make
the pod accessible to the command-line client `fluxctl`, you
will need to expose the API outside the cluster.

A simple way to do this is to piggy-back on `kubectl port-forward`,
assuming you can access the Kubernetes API:

```sh
fluxpod=$(kubectl get pod -l name=flux -o name | awk -F / '{ print $2; }')
kubectl port-forward "$fluxpod" 10080:3030 &
export FLUX_URL="http://localhost:10080/api/flux"
```

Exporting `FLUX_URL` is enough for `fluxctl` to know how to contact
the daemon. You could alternatively supply the `--url` argument
each time.

## Flux API service

Now you can easily query the Flux API:

```sh
fluxctl list-controllers --all-namespaces
```

### Local endpoint

**Beware**: this exposes the Flux API, unauthenticated, over an
insecure channel. Do not do this _unless_ you are operating Flux
entirely locally; and arguably, only to try it out.

If you are running Flux locally, e.g., in minikube, you can use a
service with a
[`NodePort`](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#type-nodeport).

An example manifest is given in
[flux-nodeport.yaml](../../deploy/flux-nodeport.yaml).

Then you can access the API on the `NodePort`, by retrieving the port
number (this example assumes you are using minikube):

```sh
fluxport=$(kubectl get svc flux --template '{{ index .spec.ports 0 "nodePort" }}')
export FLUX_URL="http://$(minikube ip):$fluxport/api/flux"
fluxctl list-controllers --all-namespaces
```

## Add an SSH deploy key to the repository

Flux connects to the repository using an SSH key. You have two
options:

### 1. Allow flux to generate a key for you.

If you don't specify a key to use, Flux will create one for you. Obtain
the public key through fluxctl:

```sh
$ fluxctl identity
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAAgQDCN2ECqUFMR413CURbLBcG41fLY75SfVZCd3LCsJBClVlEcMk4lwXxA3X4jowpv2v4Jw2qqiWKJepBf2UweBLmbWYicHc6yboj5o297//+ov0qGt/uRuexMN7WUx6c93VFGV7Pjd60Yilb6GSF8B39iEVq7GQUC1OZRgQnKZWLSQ==
0c:de:7d:47:52:cf:87:61:52:db:e3:b8:d8:1a:b5:ac
+---[RSA 1024]----+
|            ..=  |
|             + B |
|      .     . +.=|
|     . + .   oo o|
|      . S . .o.. |
|           .=.o  |
|           o =   |
|            +    |
|           E     |
+------[MD5]------+
```

Alternatively, you can see the public key in the `flux` log.

The public key will need to be given to the service hosting the Git
repository. For example, in GitHub you would create an SSH deploy key
in the repository, supplying that public key.

The `flux` logs should show that it has now connected to the
repository and synchronised the cluster.

When using Kubernetes, this key is stored as a Kubernetes secret. You
can restart `flux` and it will continue to use the same key.

### 2. Specify a key to use

Create a Kubernetes Secret from a private key:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic flux-git-deploy --from-file /path/to/identity
```

Now add the secret to the `flux-deployment.yaml` manifest:

```yaml
    ...
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: git-key
        secret:
          secretName: flux-git-deploy
```

And add a volume mount for the container:

```yaml
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluxd
        volumeMounts:
        - name: git-key
          mountPath: /etc/fluxd/ssh
```

You can customise the paths and names of the chosen key with the
arguments (examples with defaults): `--k8s-secret-name=flux-git-deploy`,
`--k8s-secret-volume-mount-path=/etc/fluxd/ssh` and
`--k8s-secret-data-key=identity`

Using an SSH key allows you to maintain control of the repository. You
can revoke permission for `flux` to access the repository at any time
by removing the deploy key.

```sh
fluxctl helps you deploy your code.

Workflow:
  fluxctl list-controllers                                           # Which controllers are running?
  fluxctl list-images --controller=deployment/foo                    # Which images are running/available?

```

# What is a Controller?

This term refers to any cluster resource responsible for the creation of
containers from versioned images - in Kubernetes these are workloads such as
Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets and CronJobs.

# Viewing Controllers

The first thing to do is to check whether Flux can see any running
controllers. To do this, use the `list-controllers` subcommand:

```sh
$ fluxctl list-controllers
CONTROLLER                     CONTAINER   IMAGE                                         RELEASE  POLICY
default:deployment/helloworld  helloworld  quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-a000001  ready
                               sidecar     quay.io/weaveworks/sidecar:master-a000002
```

Note that the actual images running will depend on your cluster.

# Inspecting the Version of a Container

Once we have a list of controllers, we can begin to inspect which versions
of the image are running.

```sh
$ fluxctl list-images --controller default:deployment/helloworld
CONTROLLER                     CONTAINER   IMAGE                          CREATED
default:deployment/helloworld  helloworld  quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld
                                           |   master-9a16ff945b9e        20 Jul 16 13:19 UTC
                                           |   master-b31c617a0fe3        20 Jul 16 13:19 UTC
                                           |   master-a000002             12 Jul 16 17:17 UTC
                                           '-> master-a000001             12 Jul 16 17:16 UTC
                               sidecar     quay.io/weaveworks/sidecar
                                           '-> master-a000002             23 Aug 16 10:05 UTC
                                               master-a000001             23 Aug 16 09:53 UTC
```

The arrows will point to the version that is currently running
alongside a list of other versions and their timestamps.

# Releasing a Controller

We can now go ahead and update a controller with the `release` subcommand.
This will check whether each controller needs to be updated, and if so,
write the new configuration to the repository.

```sh
$ fluxctl release --controller=default:deployment/helloworld --user=phil --message="New version" --update-all-images

                                           '-> master-a000002             23 Aug 16 10:05 UTC

```

# Turning on Automation

Automation can be easily controlled from within
[Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works) by selecting the "Automate"
button when inspecting a controller. But we can also do this from `fluxctl`
with the `automate` subcommand.

```sh
$ fluxctl automate --controller=default:deployment/helloworld
Commit pushed: af4bf73
CONTROLLER                     STATUS   UPDATES
default:deployment/helloworld  success

$ fluxctl list-controllers --namespace=default
CONTROLLER                     CONTAINER   IMAGE                                             RELEASE  POLICY
default:deployment/helloworld  helloworld  quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-9a16ff945b9e ready    automated
                               sidecar     quay.io/weaveworks/sidecar:master-a000002
```

We can see that the `list-controllers` subcommand reports that the
helloworld application is automated. Flux will now automatically
deploy a new version of a controller whenever one is available and commit
the new configuration to the version control system.

# Turning off Automation

Turning off automation is performed with the `deautomate` command:

```sh
$ fluxctl deautomate --controller=default:deployment/helloworld
Commit pushed: a54ef2c
CONTROLLER                     STATUS   UPDATES
default:deployment/helloworld  success

$ fluxctl list-controllers --namespace=default
CONTROLLER                     CONTAINER   IMAGE                                             RELEASE  POLICY
default:deployment/helloworld  helloworld  quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-9a16ff945b9e ready
                               sidecar     quay.io/weaveworks/sidecar:master-a000002
```

We can see that the controller is no longer automated.

# Rolling back a Controller

Rolling back can be achieved by combining:

- [`deautomate`](#turning-off-automation) to prevent Flux from automatically updating to newer versions, and
- [`release`](#releasing-a-controller) to deploy the version you want to roll back to.

```sh
$ fluxctl list-images --controller default:deployment/helloworld
CONTROLLER                     CONTAINER   IMAGE                          CREATED

# Locking a Controller

Locking a controller will stop manual or automated releases to that
controller. Changes made in the file will still be synced.

```sh
$ fluxctl lock --controller=deployment/helloworld
Commit pushed: d726722
CONTROLLER                     STATUS   UPDATES
default:deployment/helloworld  success
```

# Unlocking a Controller

Unlocking a controller allows it to have manual or automated releases
(again).

```sh
$ fluxctl unlock --controller=deployment/helloworld
Commit pushed: 708b63a
CONTROLLER                     STATUS   UPDATES
default:deployment/helloworld  success
```

# Recording user and message with the triggered action

Issuing a deployment change results in a version control change/git
commit, keeping the history of the actions. The Flux daemon can be
started with several flags that impact the commit information:

| flag              | purpose                       | default |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| git-user          | committer name                | Weave Flux |
| git-email         | committer name                | support@weave.works |
| git-set-author    | override the commit author    | false |

Actions triggered by a user through the Weave Cloud UI or the CLI `fluxctl`
tool, can have the commit author information customized. This is handy for providing extra context in the
notifications and history. Whether the customization is possible, depends on the Flux daemon (fluxd)
`git-set-author` flag. If set, the commit author will be customized in the following way:

# Image Tag Filtering

When building images it is often useful to tag build images by the branch that they were built against for example:

```
quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-9a16ff945b9e
```

Indicates that the "helloworld" image was built against master commit "9a16ff945b9e". 

When automation is turned on flux will, by default, use whatever is the latest image on a given repository. If you want to only auto-update your image against a certain subset of tags then you can do that using tag filtering.

So for example, if you want to only update the "helloworld" image to tags that were built against the "prod" branch then you could do the following:

```
fluxctl policy --controller=default:deployment/helloworld --tag-all='prod-*'
```

If your pod contains multiple containers then you tag each container individually:

```
fluxctl policy --controller=default:deployment/helloworld --tag='helloworld=prod-*' --tag='sidecar=prod-*'
``` 

## Actions triggered through `fluxctl`

`fluxctl` provides the following flags for the message and author customization:

  -m, --message string      message associated with the action
      --user    string      user who triggered the action

Commit customization

    1. Commit message

       fluxctl --message="Message providing more context for the action" .....

    2. Committer

        Committer information can be overriden with the appropriate fluxd flags:

        --git-user
        --git-email

        See [site/daemon.md] for more information.

    3. Commit author

        The default for the author is the committer information, which can be overriden,
        in the following manner:

        a) Default override uses user's git configuration, ie user.name
           and user.email (.gitconfig) to set the commit author.
           If the user has neither user.name nor for
           user.email set up, the committer information will be used. If only one
           is set up, that will be used.

        b) This can be further overriden by the use of the fluxctl --user flag.

        Examples

        a) fluxctl --user="Jane Doe <jane@doe.com>" ......
            This will always succeed as git expects a new author in the format
            "some_string <some_other_string>".

        b) fluxctl --user="Jane Doe" .......
            This form will succeed if there is already a repo commit, done by
            Jane Doe.

        c) fluxctl --user="jane@doe.com" .......
            This form will succeed if there is already a repo commit, done by
            jane@doe.com.

## Errors due to author customization

In case of no prior commit by the specified author, an error will be reported
for b) and c):

git commit: fatal: --author 'unknown' is not 'Name <email>' and matches
no existing author
