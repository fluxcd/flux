This is the changelog for the Flux daemon; the changelog for the Helm
operator is in [./CHANGELOG-helmop.md](./CHANGELOG-helmop.md).

## 1.4.2 (2018-07-05)

This release includes a number of usability improvements, the majority
of which were suggested or contributed by community members. Thanks
everyone!

### Fixes

- Don't output fluxd usage text twice
  [weaveworks/flux#1183](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1183)
- Allow dots in resource IDs; e.g., `default:deployment/foo.db`, which
  is closer to what Kubernetes allows
  [weaveworks/flux#1197](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1197)
- Log more about why git mirroring fails
  [weaveworks/flux#1171](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1171)

### Improvements

- Interpret FluxHelmRelease resources that specify multiple images to
  use in a chart
  [weaveworks/flux#1175](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/1175)
  (and several PRs that can be tracked down from there)
- Add an experimental flag for restricting the view fluxd has of the
  cluster, reducing Kubernetes API usage: `--k8s-namespace-whitelist`
  [weaveworks/flux#1184](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1184)
- Share more image layers between quay.io/weaveworks/flux and
  quay.io/weaveworks/helm-operator images
  [weaveworks/flux#1192](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1192)
- Apply resources in "dependency order" so that e.g., namespaces are
  created before things in the namespaces
  [weaveworks/flux#1117](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1117)

## 1.4.1 (2018-06-21)

This release fixes some wrinkles in the new YAML updating code, so
that YAML multidocs and kubernetes List resources are fully
supported.

It also introduces the `fluxctl sync` command, which tells Flux to
update from git and apply to Kubernetes -- as requested in
[TGI Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQz3H9bIH8Y)!

### Fixes

- Write whole files back after updates, so that multidocs and Lists
  aren't overwritten. A symptom of the problem was that a release
  would return an error something like "Verification failed: resources
  {...} were present before update and not after"
  [weaveworks/flux#1137](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1137)
- Interpret and update CronJob manifests correctly
  [weaveworks/flux#1133](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1133)

### Improvements

- Return a more helpful message when Flux can't parse YAML files
  [weaveworks/flux#1141](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1141)
- Bake SSH config into the global location (`/etc/ssh`), so that it's
  easier to override it by mounting a ConfigMap into `/root/.ssh/`
  [weaveworks/flux#1154](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1154)
- Reduce the size of list-images API/RPC responses by sending only the
  image metadata that's requested
  [weaveworks/flux#913](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/913)

## 1.4.0 (2018-06-05)

This release includes a rewrite of the YAML updating code, removing
the restrictions on using List resources and files with multiple YAML
documents, as well as fixing various bugs (like being confused by the
indentation of `container` blocks).

See https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/1.4.0/site/requirements.md
for remaining constraints.

The YAML parser preserves comments and literal quoting, but may
reindent blocks the first time it changes a file.

### Fixes

- Correct an issue the led to Flux incorrectly reporting resources as
  read-only [weaveworks/flux#1119](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1119)
- Some YAML update problems were fixed by the rewrite, the most egregious being:
  - botched releases when a YAML has indented container blocks
    [weaveworks/flux#1082](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/1082)
  - mangled annotations when using multidoc YAML files
    [weaveworks/flux#1044](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/1044)

### Improvements

- Rewrite the YAML update code to use a round-tripping parser, rather
  than regular expressions
  [weaveworks/flux#976](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/976). This
  removes the restrictions on how YAMLs are formatted, though there
  are still going to be corner cases in the parser
  ([verifying changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1094)
  will mitigate those by failing updates that would corrupt files).

## 1.3.1 (2018-05-29)

### Fixes

- Correct filtering of Helm charts when loading manifests from the git repo [weaveworks/flux#1076](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1076)
- Sync with cluster as soon as the git repository is ready [weaveworks/flux#1060](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1060)
- Avoid panic when reporting on `StatefulSet` status [weaveworks/flux#1062](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1062)

### Improvements

- Changes made to the git repo when releasing new images are now verified, meaning less chance of erroneous changes being committed [weaveworks/flux#1094](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1094)
- The ListImages API method now accepts an argument saying which fields to include for each container. This is intended to cut down the amount of data sent over the wire, since you don't always need the full list of available images [weaveworks/flux#1084](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1084)
- Add (back) the fluxd flag `--docker-config` so that image registry credentials can be supplied in a file mounted into the container [weaveworks/flux#1065](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1065). This should make it easier to work around situations in which you don't want to use imagePullSecrets on each resource.
- Label `flux` and `helm-operator` images with [Open Containers Initiative (OCI) metadata](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md) [weaveworks/flux#1075](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1075)

## 1.3.0 (2018-04-26)

### Fixes

- Exclude no-longer relevant changes from auto-releases [weaveworks/flux#1036](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1036)
- Make release and auto-release events more accurately record the
  affected resources, by looking at the calculated result [weaveworks/flux#1050](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1050)

### Improvements

- Let the flux daemon operate without a git repo, and report cluster resources as read-only when there is no corresponding manifest [weaveworks/flux#962](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/962)
- Reinstate command-line arg for setting the git polling interval `--git-poll-interval` [weaveworks/flux#1030](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1030)
- Add `--git-ci-skip` (and for more fine control, `--git-ci-skip-message`) for customising flux's commit messages such that CI systems ignore the commits [weaveworks/flux#1011](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1011)
- Log the daemon version on startup [weaveworks/flux#1017](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1017)

## 1.2.5 (2018-03-19)

### Fixes

- Handle single-quoted image values in manifests [weaveworks/flux#1008](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1008)

### Improvements

- Use a writable tmpfs volume for generating keys, since Kubernetes >=1.10 and GKE (as of March 13 2018) mount secrets as read-only [weaveworks/flux#1007](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1007)

## 1.2.4 (2018-03-14)

### Fixes

- CLI help examples updated with new resource ID format [weaveworks/flux#945](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/945)
- Fix a panic caused by accessing a `nil` map when logging events [weaveworks/flux#975](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/975)
- Properly support multi-line lock messages [weaveworks/flux#978](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/978)
- Ignore Helm charts when looking for Kubernetes manifests [weaveworks/flux#993](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/993)

### Improvements

- Enable pprof [weaveworks/flux#927](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/927/files)
- Use a Kubernetes serviceAccount when deploying Flux standalone [weaveworks/flux#972](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/972)
- Ensure at-least-once delivery of events to Weave Cloud [weaveworks/flux#973](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/973)
- Include resource sync errors when logging a sync event [weaveworks/flux#970](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/970)

### Experimental

- Alpha release of
  [helm-operator](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/master/site/helm/helm-integration.md). See
  [./CHANGELOG-helmop.md](./CHANGELOG-helmop.md) for future releases.

## 1.2.3 (2018-02-07)

### Fixes

- Fix a spin loop in the registry cache [weaveworks/flux#928](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/928)

## 1.2.2 (2018-01-31)

### Fixes

- Correctly handle YAML files with no trailing newline
  [weaveworks/flux#916](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/916)

### Improvements

The following improvements are to help if you are running a private
registry.

- Support image registries using basic authentication (rather than
  token-based authentication)
  [weaveworks/flux#915](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/915)
- Introduce the daemon argument `--registry-insecure-host` for marking
  a registry as accessible via HTTP (rather than HTTPS)
  [weaveworks/flux#918](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/918)
- Better logging of registry fetch failures, for troubleshooting
  [weaveworks/flux#898](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/898)

## 1.2.1 (2018-01-15)

### Fixes

- Fix an issue that prevented fetching tags for private repositories on DockerHub (and self-hosted registries) [weaveworks/flux#897](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/897)

## 1.2.0 (2018-01-04)

### Improvements

- Releases are more responsive, because dry runs are now done without triggering a sync [weaveworks/flux#862](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/862)
- Syncs are much faster, because they are now done all-in-one rather than calling kubectl for each resource [weaveworks/flux#872](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/872)
- Rewrite of the image registry package to solve several problems [weaveworks/flux#851](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/851)

### Fixes

- Support signed manifests (from GCR in particular) [weaveworks/flux#838](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/838)
- Support CronJobs from Kubernetes API version `batch/v1beta1`, which are present in Kubernetes 1.7 (while those from `batch/b2alpha1` are not) [weaveworks/flux#868](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/issues/868)
- Expand the GCR credentials support to `*.gcr.io` [weaveworks/flux#882](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/882)
- Check that the synced git repo is writable before syncing, which avoids a number of indirect failures [weaveworks/flux#865](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/865)
- and, [lots of other things](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pulls?q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2017-11-01)

## 1.1.0 (2017-11-01)

### Improvements

- Flux can now release updates to DaemonSets, StatefulSets and
  CronJobs in addition to Deployments. Matching Service resources are
  no longer required.

## 1.0.2 (2017-10-18)

### Improvements

- Implemented support for v2 registry manifests.

## 1.0.1 (2017-09-19)

### Improvements

- Flux daemon can be configured to populate the git commit author with
  the name of the requesting user
- When multiple flux daemons share the same configuration repository,
  each fluxd only sends Slack notifications for commits that affect
  its branch/path
- When a resource is locked the invoking user is recorded, along with
  an optional message
- When a new config repo is synced for the first time, don't send
  notifications for the entire commit history

### Fixes

- The `fluxctl identity` command only worked via the Weave Cloud
  service, and not when connecting directly to the daemon

## 1.0.0 (2017-08-22)

This release introduces significant changes to the way flux works:

- The git repository is now the system of record for your cluster
  state. Flux continually works to synchronise your cluster with the
  config repository
- Release, automation and policy actions work by updating the config
  repository

See https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/tag/1.0.0 for full
details.

## 0.3.0 (2017-05-03)

Update to support newer Kubernetes (1.6.1).

### Potentially breaking changes

- Support for Kubernetes' ReplicationControllers is deprecated; please
  update these to Deployments, which do the same job but much better
  (see
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/replication-controller/#deployment-recommended)
- The service<->daemon protocol is versioned. The daemon will now
  crash-loop, printing a warning to the log, if it tries to connect to
  the service with a deprecated version of the protocol.

### Improvements

-   Updated the version of `kubectl` bundled in the Flux daemon image,
    to work with newer (>1.5) Kubernetes.
-   Added `fluxctl save` command for bootstrapping a repo from an existing cluster
-   You can now record a message and username with each release, which
    show up in notifications

## 0.2.0 (2017-03-16)

More informative and helpful UI.

### Features

-   Lots more documentation
-   More informative output from `fluxctl release`
-   Added option in `fluxctl set-config` to generate a deploy key

### Improvements

-   Slack notifications are tidier
-   Support for releasing to >1 service at a time
-   Better behaviour when flux deploys itself
-   More help given for commonly encountered errors
-   Filter out Kubernetes add-ons from consideration
-   More consistent Prometheus metric labeling
