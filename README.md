# Flux

We believe in GitOps:

- **You declaratively describe the entire desired state of your
  system in git.** This includes the apps, config, dashboards,
  monitoring and everything else.
- **What can be described can be automated.** Use YAMLs to enforce
  conformance of the system. You don't need to run `kubectl`, all changes go
  through git. Use diff tools to detect divergence between observed and
  desired state and get notifications.
- **You push code not containers.** Everything is controlled through
  pull requests. There is no learning curve for new devs, they just use
  your standard git PR process. The history in git allows you to recover
  from any snapshot as you have an sequence of transactions. It is much
  more transparent to make operational changes by pull request, e.g.
  fix a production issue via a pull request instead of making changes to
  the running system.

Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster
matches the config in git. It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger
deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool.
It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers
deployments and updates the desired running configuration based on that
(and a configurable policy).

The benefits are: you don't need to grant your CI access to the cluster, every
change is atomic and transactional, git has your audit log. Each transaction
either fails or succeeds cleanly. You're entirely code centric and don't need
new infrastructure.

## What Flux does

Flux is most useful when used as a deployment tool at the end of a
Continuous Delivery pipeline. Flux will make sure that your new
container images and config changes are propagated to the cluster.

### Features

Its major features are:

- [Automated git â†’ cluster synchronisation](/site/introduction.md#automated-git-cluster-synchronisation)
- [Automated deployment of new container images](/site/introduction.md#automated-deployment-of-new-container-images)
- [Integrations with other devops tools](/site/introduction.md#integrations-with-other-devops-tools) ([Helm](/site/helm/helm-integration.md) and more)
- No additional service or infrastructure needed - Flux lives inside your
  cluster
- Straight-forward control over the state of deployments in the
  cluster (rollbacks, lock a specific version of a workload, manual
  deployments)
- Observability: git commits are an audit trail, and you can record
  e.g., why a given deployment was locked.

### Relation to Weave Cloud

Weave Cloud is a SaaS product by Weaveworks that includes Flux, as well
as:

 - a UI and alerts for deployments: nicely integrated overview, all flux
   operations just a click away.
 - full observability and insights into your cluster: Instantly start using
   monitoring dashboards for your cluster, hosted 13 months of history, use
   a realtime map of your cluster to debug and analyse its state.

If you want to learn more about Weave Cloud, you can see it in action on
[its homepage](https://www.weave.works/product/cloud/).
