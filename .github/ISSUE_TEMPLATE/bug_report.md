# ---- NOTICE -----

Flux v1 is in maintenance mode and Flux v2 is getting closer to GA.
If you want to learn about migrating to Flux v2, please review
<https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/413>.

As it will take longer until we get around to issues and PRs in
Flux v1, we strongly recommend that you starting familiaring yourself
with Flux v2: <https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/>

This means that new features will only be added after very careful
consideration, if at all. Refer to the links above for more detail.
