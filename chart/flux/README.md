# Flux

Flux is a tool that automatically ensures that the state of a cluster matches the config in git.
It uses an operator in the cluster to trigger deployments inside Kubernetes, which means you don't need a separate CD tool.
It monitors all relevant image repositories, detects new images, triggers deployments and updates the desired running
configuration based on that (and a configurable policy).

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Flux](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux) deployment on
a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes >= v1.9 is recommended. Kubernetes v1.8 (the first to support
Custom Resources) appears to have problems with repeated application of
custom resources (see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/53379).
This means fluxd can fail to apply changes to FluxHelmRelease resources.

### Helm

Tiller should be running in the cluster, though
[helm-operator](../../site/helm-operator.md) will wait
until it can find one.

# Git repo

 - One repo containing both desired release state information and Charts
   themselves.
 - Release state information in the form of Custom Resources manifests is
   located under a particular path ("releaseconfig" by default; can be
   overriden).
 - Charts are colocated under another path ("charts" by default; can be
   overriden). Charts are subdirectories under the charts path.
 - Custom Resource namespace reflects where the release should be done.
   Both the Helm release and its corresponding Custom Resource will
   live in this namespace.
 - Example of a test repo: https://github.com/weaveworks/flux-helm-test

## Installation

We put together a simple [Get Started
guide](../../site/helm-get-started.md) which takes about 5-10 minutes to follow.
You will have a fully working Flux installation deploying workloads to your
cluster.

## Installing Flux using Helm

### Installing the Chart

Add the weaveworks repo:

```sh
helm repo add weaveworks https://weaveworks.github.io/flux
```

#### To install the chart with the release name `flux`:

```console
$ helm install --name flux \
--set git.url=ssh://git@github.com/weaveworks/flux-example \
--namespace flux \
weaveworks/flux
```

#### To connect Flux to a Weave Cloud instance:

```console
helm install --name flux \
--set token=YOUR_WEAVE_CLOUD_SERVICE_TOKEN \
--namespace flux \
weaveworks/flux
```

#### To install Flux with the Helm operator:

```console
$ helm install --name flux \
--set git.url=ssh://git@github.com/weaveworks/flux-helm-test \
--set helmOperator.create=true \
--namespace flux \
weaveworks/flux
```

#### To install Flux with a private git host:

When using a private git host, setting the `ssh.known_hosts` variable 
is required for enabling successful key matches because `StrictHostKeyChecking` 
is enabled during flux git daemon operations.

By setting the `ssh.known_hosts` variable, a configmap will be created
called `flux-ssh-config` which in turn will be mounted into a volume named
`sshdir` at `/root/.ssh/known_hosts`.

* Get the `ssh.known_hosts` keys by running the following command:

```bash
ssh-keyscan <your_git_host_domain>
```

To prevent a potential man-in-the-middle attack, one should
verify the ssh keys acquired through the `ssh-keyscan` match expectations
using an alternate mechanism.

* Start flux and flux helm operator:

  - Using a string for setting `known_hosts`
  
    ```sh
    YOUR_GIT_HOST=your_git_host.example.com
    KNOWN_HOSTS='domain ssh-rsa line1
    domain ecdsa-sha2-line2
    domain ssh-ed25519 line3'
    
    helm install \
    --name flux \
    --set helmOperator.create=true \
    --set git.url="ssh://git@${YOUR_GIT_HOST}:weaveworks/flux-helm-test.git" \
    --set-string ssh.known_hosts="${KNOWN_HOSTS}" \
    --namespace flux \
    chart/flux 
    ```
    
  - Using a file for setting `known_hosts`
  
    Copy known_hosts keys into a temporary file `/tmp/flux_known_hosts`
    
    ```sh
    YOUR_GIT_HOST=your_git_host.example.com
    
    helm install \
    --name flux \
    --set helmOperator.create=true \
    --set git.url="ssh://git@${YOUR_GIT_HOST}:weaveworks/flux-helm-test.git" \
    --set-file ssh.known_hosts=/tmp/flux_known_hosts \
    --namespace flux \
    chart/flux 
    ```

The [configuration](#configuration) section lists all the parameters that can be configured during installation.

#### Setup Git deploy

At startup Flux generates a SSH key and logs the public key.
Find the SSH public key with:

```bash
kubectl -n flux logs deployment/flux | grep identity.pub | cut -d '"' -f2
```

In order to sync your cluster state with GitHub you need to copy the public key and
create a deploy key with write access on your GitHub repository.
Go to _Settings > Deploy keys_ click on _Add deploy key_, check
_Allow write access_, paste the Flux public key and click _Add key_.

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `flux` deployment:

```console
helm delete --purge flux
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
You should also remove the deploy key from your GitHub repository.
