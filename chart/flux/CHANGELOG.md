## 0.6.0 (2019-01-14)

**Note** To fix the connectivity problems between Flux and memcached we've changed the
memcached service from headless to ClusterIP. This change will make the Helm upgrade fail
with `ClusterIP field is immutable`.

Before upgrading to 0.6.0 you have to delete the memcached headless service:

```bash
kubectl -n flux delete svc flux-memcached
```

    - Rectify error where `resources` are not `None` by default in `chart/flux/values.yaml`
    - Add more fields that are actually in `chart/flux/values.yaml`
    - Separate `replicaCount` into a Flux one and `helmOperator.replicaCount` one
  - Only create the `flux-helm-tls-ca-config` file if `.Values.helmOperator.tls.caContent` exists.
    Useful when doing Flux upgrades but do not happen to know or want to specify
    the `caContent` in `values.yaml`. Otherwise, the existing caContent will be overriden with an
    empty value.
    [weaveworks/flux#1649](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1649)
  - Add Flux AWS ECR flags
    [weaveworks/flux#1655](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/pull/1655)
